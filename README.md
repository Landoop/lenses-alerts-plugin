## Lenses Alert integration for Slack

This is a Lenses plugin allowing to push Lenses raised alerts to slack.

### Configuration

In order to enable the plugin, the following settings have to be set in Lenses:

```
    lenses.alerting.plugins = [
      {
        class=io.lenses.alerts.plugin.slack.SlackAlertsPlugin
        config={
          webhook-url="https://hooks.slack.com/services/SECRET/YYYYYYYYYYY/XXXXXXXX"
          username=Lensesâ„¢
          channel=lenses-slack
        }
      }
    ]
```

Apart from the above the plugin requires a few extra configurations as seen in the table below.
